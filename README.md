## About

- Considering the long-term and practical significance of the project, we chose the theme of **tourism**. The purpose of "going out for sightseeing" is to travel to a certain destination, that is to say, the purpose of traveling is to travel to a certain destination. As a way for people to broaden their horizons and relax their body and mind, tourism has a **high universality**. No matter children or middle-aged and old people can find their own tourism mode through different tourism modes, tourist attractions and tourist routes. Therefore, the theme of tourism can be said to be eternal.
  
- We consider that many major tourism websites are about the information collection of **scenic spots, hotels, transportation and tourism strategies**, which is mainly applicable to the preliminary direction planning. However, due to the excessive information, it will take a long time to screen the information if we want to make a detailed planning. Therefore, our website reduces the presentation of traffic and strategy, adding the information of future **weather** conditions and the function of **route planning**, which solves the problem of finding the best route in the process of medium-term detailed planning to save the travel time to the greatest extent, and provides help for checking the weather in the next few days and adjusting the route in the process of later preparation and travel. We have searched and summarized the **hotel information** with good quality and low price, so as to facilitate users to understand the accommodation information.

- There are some advantages of our website:

  All modules are displayed on a website based on **Django** library, which is easy to operate and practical.

  All information in this website is **instant information**, which is valuable for the users who are about to travel.

  **Hyperlinks** are set up in the web pages of hotels and popular scenic spots to facilitate users to enter relevant websites to inquire more detailed information or make purchase decisions.

  We give first priority to the **interaction with users**. Users can choose to view the relevant content of any city in the country; users can also choose the scenic spots they want to visit, and we provide them with the design of the best route; they can also choose to view the hotel information in a certain price range.

  We also pay attention to the summary of information and statistics of data. Whether it is hot spots, hotel prices or weather conditions, we use scientific methods to make statistics, and use **pygal** and **pyecharts** libraries to design **good-looking charts or maps** for display.
